# ApacheAirflow-Questions
<ol>
<li><h2>What is Apache Airflow?</h2>
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows users to create directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks, which can be executed on a schedule or in response to an event.

<li><h2>What are the key components of Apache Airflow?</h2>
The key components of Apache Airflow are:
<ul>
<li>Web Server: provides the web interface for users to interact with Airflow
<li>Scheduler: schedules and runs the DAGs
<li>Executor: executes the tasks in the DAGs
<li>Metadata Database: stores the state of DAGs, tasks, and task instances
<li>Workers: performs the actual work of executing tasks
</ul>

<li><h2>What is a DAG in Apache Airflow?</h2>
DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph. In Apache Airflow, a DAG is a collection of tasks arranged in a specific order, where each task is dependent on the successful completion of the previous task. It defines the dependencies and the order in which tasks should be executed.

<li><h2>What is a task in Apache Airflow?</h2>
A task is a unit of work in Apache Airflow. It is a single operation that needs to be performed in a DAG. A task can be any Python function, Bash script, or executable, and can be customized with various parameters such as retries, priority, and timeout.

<li><h2>Implement tag and dag in apache airflow</h2>
from airflow import DAG<br>
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator<br>
from datetime import datetime

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2023, 2, 26),
}

dag = DAG('example_dag', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='@daily')

task1 = BashOperator(task_id='task1', bash_command='echo "Hello World from Task 1!"', dag=dag)

task2 = BashOperator(task_id='task2', bash_command='echo "Hello World from Task 2!"', dag=dag)

task1 >> task2

<li><h2>What is the difference between a DAG and a task in Apache Airflow?</h2>
A DAG is a collection of tasks arranged in a specific order, where each task is dependent on the successful completion of the previous task. On the other hand, a task is a single operation that needs to be performed in a DAG. In other words, a DAG defines the dependencies and the order in which tasks should be executed, while a task defines what needs to be done.

<li><h2>What is a sensor in Apache Airflow?</h2>
A sensor is a type of task in Apache Airflow that waits for a certain condition to be met before proceeding to the next task in a DAG. For example, a File Sensor can wait for a file to be created in a specific directory before executing the next task.

<li><h2>What is the difference between a DAG and a workflow in Apache Airflow?</h2>
In Apache Airflow, a DAG is a collection of tasks arranged in a specific order, while a workflow is a set of tasks that perform a specific business process. A workflow can consist of one or more DAGs, and can be used to automate complex business processes.

<li><h2>How do you debug an Apache Airflow DAG?</h2>
There are several ways to debug an Apache Airflow DAG, such as:
<ul>
<li>Use the web interface to view the status of individual tasks and their logs
<li>Use the command line to run the tasks manually and view the output
<li>Use the Python debugger to step through the code and view variables and state
<li>Use logging statements to output debug information
</ul>

<li><h2>What is the purpose of XCom in Apache Airflow</h2>
XCom (short for cross-communication) is a feature in Apache Airflow that allows tasks to exchange messages, such as data or metadata, with each other. It can be used to pass information between tasks in a DAG, even if they are not directly connected.

<li><h2>What is a DAGBag in Apache Airflow?</h2>
A DAGBag is a collection of DAGs that are loaded into Apache Airflow. It is used by the Scheduler to determine which DAGs to run and when to run them.

<li><h2>How do you monitor the progress of a DAG in Apache Airflow? </h2>
Monitor.py<br>
  from airflow.models import DagRun

  dag_id = 'example_dag'

  dag_runs = DagRun.find(dag_id=dag_id, state='running')
  
  for dag_run in dag_runs:

    dag_run.update_state()
    
    print('DAG run "{}" is in state "{}"'.format(dag_run, dag_run.state))

</ol>
